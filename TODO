Read in Node attributes (if available)
- PCA -> KMeans on contiuous features
- OneHot encode categoricals

! What if a node has null e.g. no value for a particular feature?
- maybe attribute encoding should be done on the basis of Node type (e.g. ZIPCode nodes don't have a LLC_Type feature)


Experiments:

    1. Handling irrelevant features 
    Either omit, or mark not relevant

    Person 1 highEarner  e1  Person 4 mediumEarner  e0  ZIPCode 2  e3  ...
    or
    Person 1 highEarner  e1  Person 4 mediumEarner  e0  ZIPCode 2 BLANK_CHARACTER  e3  ...

    2. Create a new word combining node_label, graphwave_label, and attribute values



AIDs dataset has node_attributes
- figure out how to express preprocessing operations as sklearn pipelines
    - e.g. clustering on x,y coord pairs




## Parameters to play with

## Immediate next steps
- Figure out license
- Add edge attributes
- Finish end-to-end Colab notebook example
